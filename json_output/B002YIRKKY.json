The large array of shapes can be made into people, animals and puppets, as well as interesting jewelry with a little imagination.  My one complaint is that, especially for the younger kids (4), the male connectors can be bent if the child is having a hard time connecting or disconnecting pieces.

She quickly went from disappointment to real excitement. In no time at all the Pop-Arty Beads were the hit of the party.

You can even make flowers by placing a smaller bead inside a larger shell.This also comes with some blank jewelry pieces.  It comes with bracelets and rings that can have beads snapped on decoratively.  It comes with a few in different colors.I love that you can make some jewelry, wear it a few days, then use the same pieces and make something totally different the next week!!If you have a craft loving, artistic, creative or jewelry loving kiddo, these are absolutely fantastic.

Just follow Mommy's directions.\" Except when the car gets a flat tire, then she'll stand by the side of the road and hope some nice man changes her tire for her. Under her superior supervision of course. Last but not least, Adam age 3 holding a tow truck during show and tell: \"This is my hooker.\" Is this meant for kids to read?
