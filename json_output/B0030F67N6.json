This one however is for my 6 month olds Christmas present so I am unable to speak on this exact order.. Although I have ordered this product for both of my other two kids when they were around about the same age. (1st was 4 months, and the 2nd was 5 months) So basically once they were old enough to  start attempting to hold and/or play \"somewhat\" independently. These things are wonderful, especially for those who prefer to buy their little ones toys they won't just out grow in a few months. First off they squeek when you squeeze them, and what baby doesn't like that? They aren't hard or heavy so it makes it perfect for infants. They are made out of the same material as bath toys, therefore they can also be brought into the bath, pool, ext. (They float!!) the little air hole allows water to get into the block so you can even squirt water out of them. (Note: if you do allow your child to play in water with these *as well as any bath toy with a hole* attempt to get all excess water out afterwards every time to attempt to keep mold from growing inside. *soaking bathtoys in water with a little bleach once a week can also help*) But Bc they are waterproof this also mean drool doesn't effect them!! Yet again, perfect for a teething infant where of course everything goes into their mouth and becomes drinched! Lol. But we can even move foward a few years.. The animal designs and numbers on the side make them perfect for even older children! For example my 2 1/2 year old still enjoys his as he is learning to recognize his numbers, animals, colors, and pretty much everything he sees! (Notice I threw in colors; this is also great to teach toddlers colors!) I'm gonna take it a few more years further even.. They are rubber BLOCKS *with numbers* all kids enjoy stacking their toys. At 7 years old, my daughter still plays with hers also.. Stacking them by numbers into pyramids, or just using her imagination to see what she can build. So there you go, at least 7 years of play (if you choose) and Gender neutral as my daughter and both of my sons now have their own set! Tons of different uses and can last several years..

be afraid of baby being hit or falling on these and hurting themself.2) durable construction- rubber3) reasonable size for small hands4) multiple (bright) colors to teach baby5) numerals6) animals (puppy, lion, duck, kittens, giraffe...)7) counting opportunity...i really am stumped for a better explanation right now. but what i really intend to say is that eg on the block numbered two (1 face) there are two lions (covering 4 faces) as well as two swirls (1 face) so not only can u teach the little ones to recognize the two lions but also u can learn to count based on the objects.most toys that i have come across stop counting at nine but this one goes to ten. so u have ten colors, numerals 1-10, ten different animals as well as item count according to the number on one block. and if that is not all- the hole in one side allows it to become a squeak toy as well.great buy really", "author": "Carlos De Cunha", "numerical": 5.0}, {"response_object": {"sentiment": {"document":

The blocks in this set are squishy, colorful and smooth - they also squeak when you squeeze them - so they are perfect for a teething infant.  He does not grow bored of them too quickly because there are 12 of them, so he usually goes through chewing and squeezing each one of them before he throws them all over the place.  Then we just stack them up and start all over again (he also loves to knock them down after stacked).  They are great if you want something different from the normal teething rings and toys for teething babies.  They also have little animal pictures, designs and numbers on them so they have that added educational quality as well allowing them to be used in the later years.  To boot, they are very inexpensive - so all around, it is a win-win!", "author": "Diane H", "numerical": 5.0}, {"response_object": {"sentiment": {"document": {"score": 0.0542682, "label": "positive"}}, "semantic_roles": [{"subject": {"text": "these"}, "sentence": "these are great- love them! they are soft and squeezable and baby loves them! he plays with them more then his wooden blocks plus they are larger then average -so easier to stack.", "object": {"text": "great- love them"}, "action": {"verb": {"text": "be", "tense": "present"}, "text": "are", "normalized": "be"}}, {"subject": {"text": "they"}, "sentence": "these are great- love them! they are soft and squeezable and baby loves them! he plays with them more then his wooden blocks plus they are larger then average -so easier to stack.", "object": {"text": "soft and squeezable"}, "action": {"verb": {"text": "be", "tense": "present"}, "text": "are", "normalized": "be"}}, {"subject": {"text": "soft and squeezable and baby"}, "sentence": "these are great- love them! they are soft and squeezable and baby loves them! he plays with them more then his wooden blocks plus they are larger then average -so easier to stack.", "object": {"text": "them"}, "action": {"verb": {"text": "love", "tense": "present"}, "text": "loves", "normalized": "love"}}, {"subject": {"text": "they"}, "sentence": "these are great- love them! they are soft and squeezable and baby loves them! he plays with them more then his wooden blocks plus they are larger then average -so easier to stack.", "object": {"text": "larger then average -so easier"}, "action": {"verb": {"text": "be", "tense": "present"}, "text": "are", "normalized": "be"}}, {"subject": {"text": "they"}, "sentence": "these are great- love them! they are soft and squeezable and baby loves them! he plays with them more then his wooden blocks plus they are larger then average -so easier to stack.", "object": {"text": "his wooden blocks plus"}, "action": {"verb": {"text": "stack", "tense": "future"}, "text": "to stack", "normalized": "to stack"}}, {"subject": {"text": "they"}, "sentence": " BUT they are nine dollars at target! so shame on you amazon for overpricing these!!!!", "object": {"text": "nine dollars at target"}, "action": {"verb": {"text": "be", "tense": "present"}, "text": "are", "normalized": "be"}}], "relations": [], "language": "en", "keywords": [{"text": "wooden blocks", "relevance": 0.957138}, {"text": "great- love", "relevance": 0.882488}, {"text": "shame", "relevance": 0.745718}, {"text": "dollars", "relevance": 0.739256}, {"text": "target", "relevance": 0.713627}, {"text": "baby", "relevance": 0.677041}], "entities": [{"type": "Company", "text": "amazon", "relevance": 0.889835, "count": 1}, {"type": "Quantity", "text": "nine dollars", "relevance": 0.889835, "count": 1}], "emotion": {"document": {"emotion": {"sadness": 0.011168, "joy": 0.879431, "fear": 0.0433, "disgust": 0.034341, "anger": 0.038635}}}, "concepts": [{"text": "Love", "relevance": 0.91136, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love"}, {"text": "Amazon.com", "relevance": 0.824514, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazon.com"}], "categories": [{"score": 0.251729, "label": "/business and industrial"}, {"score": 0.23687, "label": "/shopping/retail"}, {"score": 0.228022, "label": "/hobbies and interests/reading"}]}, "text": "these are great- love them! they are soft and squeezable and baby loves them! he plays with them more then his wooden blocks plus they are larger then average -so easier to stack.

These come in beautiful, unique, very rich colors and they're wonderfully detailed and visually interesting.  Right now, they're great because they are textured and ridged and a perfect squeezable texture, so he can easily grab them and manipulate them.  As my son is learning to crawl now, they are a great target for him to try to reach.  Later, they will be perfect for learning numbers, animals, shapes, and the not-so-typical colors.

As parents, we are making a concerted effort not to buy toys made in China.  The tag affixed to the product (the square tag shown in the product picture) says it is \"Manufactured by Battat, Inc.\" in Plattsburgh, NY or Montreal, P.Q.  I was excited to see a toy product not made in China and with the possibility of it manufactured in New York State (I am from NYS)! It wasn't until I brought the product home when I noticed the back-side of the tag said \"Made in China!\"  How can these blocks be manufactured by a company located in Plattsburgh or Montreal but made in China?  I called the customer service number and representative told me the blocks are made in China but the TAG is made in Plattsburgh??  Huh??? First of all, why would I care where the tag was made? My child will be playing with the blocks, not the tag.  And secondly, I find the whole situation very misleading.  Why doesn't the tag say \"Manufactured FOR Battat, Inc?\"However, this set of blocks is quite nice.  They are easy to stack even though they are soft and rubbery.  They even have nice artistic detail to them.  Some of the block faces have animals, while others have numbers, and some have shapes.  They come in a convenient storage bag. My son likes to squeeze them to make them squeak.After a bit of contemplation, we decided to keep the product.  I am giving this product a 3-star rating because they initially mislead me into thinking they were made in the USA.
