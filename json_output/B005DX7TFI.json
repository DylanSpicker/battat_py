Toy I have purchased in the last 3 months & love them all.

The bugs are awesome also she chews on their little wings & loves dragging them around with her as she crawls from room to room & gets a kick out of holding them up in the air & making them wiggle! She also has the parum pum pum instruments & loves to make music with them unfortunately we are holding off giving her the drumsticks til she is older. She recently celebrated her 1st birthday & received the zany zoo from her uncle B (coincidence I think not) & they both are having a blast with it!!!!Awesome toys & really well madeDefinitely will continue to purchase them well worth every centThanks for all the thought & energy put into creating these wonderful toys ...Sharon Petricca", "author": "sharon petricca", "numerical": 5.0},
