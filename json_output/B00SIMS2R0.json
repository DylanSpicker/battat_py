The biplane comes partially assembled. It's nice that the box stays in tact after you open it up so you can use it to store the parts. The drill uses very common AA batteries, which makes powering this toy fairly easy. If you don't have the batteries you can still use the pieces like manual tools or even simply use your hands. The plastic is thick enough to be durable for the little ones. This is not recommended for infants since the bolts can be choking hazards.When I showed my son the plane he was so excited. He couldn't wait to open it up. The instructions were clear. It wasn't long after we put the batteries in the drill that this neat little biplane to was assembled. He rolled it on the floor a few times and pretended it was flying. After a few minutes he was ready to take it part and put it back together again. He did the over and over for about an hour.

I have been looking for just the right toy like this and I think this is just about as good as it gets.  It isn't perfect but few things are.  What we love about it:- Came packaged very nicely and with instructions- Is very well made!  Unlike other toys of this kind that I've tried by another company, these plastic pieces are all very solid and sturdy instead of flimsy and bendable.- Is big!  It's bigger than I expected which is nice!  Makes it much easier for little hands to assemble and manipulate the pieces.- The included power screwdriver (which takes two AA batteries) works well and has different screw bits that can be used and swapped out very easily.  I bought other versions of take apart toys from other companies that come with regular screwdrivers but those are still too complicated for my son to operate.  Power was the way to go!- Screwdriver rotates both ways for screwing in and taking out by a small switch on the underside of the barrel.- While a little difficult for my impatient son at first, it's pretty intuitive and he started picking it up quickly.- Fun to play with when it's done!  The propellor spins (not powered) and the wheels roll.Things that could be better:- While it's great that the screwdriver rotates both ways, it can be confusing for a little one to figure out which way it's going on their own.

I put it all together and just gave him the plane but he could tell the bolts came out and was using everything to try to get them out. After watching him try and try to get the bolts off I finally have him the drill and showed him how to use it and that was that! Obviously at 2 he can't put it all together by himself, but he can with some help! He loves using the drill and knows how to make it go both ways to take it off and put the bolts back in. I hide the drill and give it to him when we have time to take it all apart and put it back together so we don't lose any pieces, but he plays with it all put together in the mean time!

He was 2.  We had to help him use it for a few months, but he can now put it together and take it apart by himself.  He is now 3 1/2.  He LOVES this toy.  We have not had any issue with the driver, except when the batteries get low, or if he has tightened the nuts on the wheels too much, then I have to manually help them a little before he can use the driver.  He also has some plastic manual screwdrivers that fit the screws so he can use those as well.  It's a great toy, and when he gets the urge to take things apart around the house, I can redirect him to this.  He rarely uses it just as an airplane, but is definitely interested in the taking apart and putting together process.The clear plastic cockpit piece is a little difficult to place correctly, so I

"This plane is huge. I was expecting a small toy and it is not small. It takes up a lot of space. My 3-year-old does like putting it together and taking it apart. For the most part, it is easy to play with but it does require some parental involvement as the screwdriver and screw pieces are just really bulky. I wish that it came with a storage case or some type of canvas bag to keep all of the screwdriver heads and screwdriver in.
