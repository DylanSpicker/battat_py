well.There are three posts and three tubes situated in a circle.

Each tube has a unique shape with a matching toy.  These toys have a whistle in them, so that when the shape slides down the tube it whistles.  My son walks around with them in his mouth, blowing and sucking on them to make noise.These tubes are what enable the Battat to function as a shape sorter (unlike most shape sorters).  Since the shapes go into tubes, you retrieve them by turning it upside down.  That means no lid is necessary, so if your child wants to put the blocks in, he has to put them through the shaped holes.Though I'm disappointed that there's only one block of each shape, I much prefer this shape sorter to the one I purchased with a removable, non-latching lid.

Very sturdy and well made.How I base my reviews-1 star- This item is horrible, disappointing and I will be returning it.2 stars- means there was something I may have liked, but very little and I still feel disappointed3 stars- It is SO-SO there's nothing particularly wrong with it.. it's okay and do not feel like I wasted my money-4 stars- I like it- Higher than average in general, or several aspects really stand out and it would be a five star if it weren't for one or two things that are only fair or less than fair. (price vs product). It is worth purchasing again.5- I LOVE it! I would not think twice about purchasing another one for myself or for a gift.

I had this toy for years and it was a big hit with my babies... then we lost a piece in a move.  I got on amazon and got two for twelve dollars each (one for a gift): the square didn't work in both.  Did the returns process.  One replacement was fine.  The other: the triangle didn't work.  Luckily, two had the same color theme, so I was able to switch out the good pieces for the defective pieces, and I ended up with two working sets out of four, even though THREE out of FOUR were defective.If you're willing to play with those odds, go for it.  For me, it was worth the returns process as this toy is quite fun.  OKAY it's not going to entertain your baby for hours - no toy does.  But it is an educational toy, and baby has to do more than wave her hand to get an onslaught of lights and sounds and motion for entertainment.  These kinds of toys are getting few and far between.This toy can be used quite early.  My current young'un is 8 months old.  She cannot sort these by herself, but she likes to pick up the shapes and blow in them to make the kazoo-like sounds.  She likes to play with the shaped beads on the base unit.  And her siblings guide her hands to sort the shapes correctly.  I like this toy because she actually has to DO something with this toy.Incidentally, this toy was my hearing impaired daughter's favorite toy as a baby.  She would take the shapes with her everywhere when she was crawling and toddling, so she could blow in them and get that buzzing kazoo-like sound.  She didn't care for electronic sounds as much as this funny buzzing sound.
