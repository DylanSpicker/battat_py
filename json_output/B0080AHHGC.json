To adults, it may seem a bit too large, but smaller children find it easy to use as they do not have to carefully pack things to have them all fit.  The stethescope is particularly nice - its simulated heartbeat brought shouts of glee when my grandson first used it on \"Papa.\"  While there is a pager included in the kit, the manufacturer might also consider adding a toy \"smart phone\" in keeping with current trends.  The other instruments - otoscope, blood-pressure cuff, thermometer, oral mirror, tweezers, syringe, and scissors - provide a variety of \"healthcare\" options and help foster imaginative play.\"B. Doctor\" is constructed and finished well.  There are no rough edges that could cut tender skin and no itty-bitty copmponents that might accidentally get put somewhere they should not have gone.\"B. Doctor\" is definitly a 5-star toy.  However, you should be aware that the price fluctuates greatly; I have seen it on Amazon from as low as $21+ to somewhere in the $30 range.

years ago when my daughter was a year old.  My daughter is now five and my son is two.  Both of them play with this kit, but it isn't perfect.  By far my favorite aspect of the kit is the large, sturdy box.  At first, I was taken aback at how little is in the kit, but quickly I learned that it is great to put other things in that \"go with\" the original contents such as  a couple of toy phones, empty \"medicine\" bottles, and a bandage (aka a scarf).  The lid is also very sturdy.  It does have a \"complex\" lock for a child, but they absolutely can learn to operate it.  My children had no trouble with it because they are used to opening and closing toy locks of all kinds.  The beeper never worked and was of poor quality, but since we have a very sturdy B Toys Cel Phone that works despite being run ragged, I let it go as a quality control issue.  The stethoscope ear plugs are too big and stiff for big or little ears, but that didn't prevent the children from playing with it since they mostly hung it around their neck.  They though the jazzy hear beat was funny.  The syringe was a big hit.  I know people were irritated that it came apart and squeaked, but that is how the toy is designed.  It generates a satisfying sound without needing a battery!  The kids like to take it all the way out and make it \"pop\".  The otoscope, mirror, and tweezers work as intended.  They are big in comparison to other kits, but that's what I was looking for.  The blood pressure band worked great at the start even though the bulb was hard to press, but after a year or so the stiff plastic gave way and the bulb just split and came off.  Overall, the kids enjoy the toy and play with it, but it really needs a redesign of the beeper, blood pressure cuff, and the ear pieces of the stethoscope.", "author": "TD", "numerical": 3.0},

In response to some negative reviews: my daughter is 2 1/2 and has no trouble opening the latches on the kit.  In fact, they're super-easy to open.  They are a bit unusual, so you may have to show your child how to do it first, but once they know what to do, it doesn't require much strength or dexterity to do it.  The kit is bigger than it really needs to be for what comes in it, but it's nice not to have to try to figure out how to cram everything into a tiny container and it has been fun to add things to the kit, like an Ace bandage, stickers for being brave, etc.  We have an absolutely teensy house, so I'm really against large toys and I wasn't at all daunted by the size of this.  I actually kind of like the fact that the stethoscope makes a sound when you press the button because, from the reviews, it seems the ones that really \"work\" don't work that well.

Some of the kits that are a different shape can have one side fall open if not latched tightly or have equipment fall out when one side is raised up.  I also purchased the kit because it contains 9 pieces of doctor's equipment, which I can supplement with items such as band aids and tongue depressors, according to age of child. When wearing the stethoscope, the child presses on a large red button and holds down; the result gives a heartbeat sound. With two AAA batteries (not supplied), the pager produces three sounds when the child presses on buttons. As someone commented, they are noisy sounds, but you can remove the pager if you think the sounds will be too annoying. I commend B. Toys for their efforts to recycle when possible.

Doc McStuffins right now.  Unfortunately the Doc McStuffins kit is practically unattainable and is way over priced on here right now, due to people buying them all up and reselling them for a ridiculous price.  Anyway, back to this product.  I bought this based on the reviews I read on here saying how great the product was.  It is cute but I have some problems with it.  1.  The box/carry case for all the medical stuff is a great size, has extra room to put in extra stuff like a \"prescription\" pad, little doctors outfit, etc.  But the lid is not hinged, so the whole thing comes off and is difficult for a 3 year old to put back on themselves.  2.  The \"instruments\" are good quality but the stethoscope ear pieces are so big they don't even fit in my ears, the blood pressure cuff is good, except the readout is the same color as the dial and there is only 1 little yellow arrow, this should have numbers or some contrasting color read out or something.  The otoscope is cheaper and smaller than others I have seen.  Otherwise, my kid actually seems to love it and both my husband and I as well as our 1 year old have undergone many checkups with this kit since we gave it to our 3 year old.

Most of the Dr. Kits are for 3 and up, but really you need that type pretend play when they are younger and more fearful of routine Dr visits.  This kit was safe for my 15 month old, but enjoyed by my 3 1/2 year old. The toys are safe for younger children, but look enough like real tools for them to be able to associate it with the real Dr.'s tool. I was not sure about the 'pager', but you will be glad the buttons are hard to press, because it is noisy, hopefully they figure out how to push it when they can understand quiet time! The box is large, but it allows you to add a white shirt (Dr. Coat,)empty band aid box, etc. as they get older for more imaginative play. I wish all toys with pieces came in a reusable storage container!

I bought him the Scoots Toddler Scrubs and a cheap Learning Resources Stethoscope which he really loves.  If I had it to do over, I would probably get a little backpack with the aforementioned stethoscope, add some rolls of gauze wrap, ace wrap, little candies in a tin, maybe a disposable Penlight, plastic magnifying glass, reflex hammer, bulb syringe... stuff like that.  Real stuff that isn't sharp ...instead of the plastic stuff in this box (which isn't easy for a kid to open PLUS the whole lid comes off.  Would be better with a hinged lid)  The box is also big and clunky..  Would be cooler if they sold little medical bags with a red cross on them and you could fill them with cheap medical supplies.  It came with a clunky battery operated stethoscope that would make some kind of \"heart sounds' and an annoying \"pager\".  The Learning Resources Stethoscope was much better....listen to REAL heart sounds.  Depends on the kid, I guess.
